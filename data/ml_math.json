                "**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the data into a new coordinate system. The new axes (principal components) are the directions of maximum variance in the data. PCA reduces the dimensionality by projecting the data onto the top principal components, preserving as much variance as possible. Itâs commonly used for feature extraction, noise reduction, and data visualization, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets."

It works by minimizing the divergence between probability distributions of points in high-dimensional space and their corresponding low-dimensional space. t-SNE is particularly useful for visualizing clusters and patterns in complex, high-dimensional datasets. Unlike PCA, which focuses on maximizing variance, t-SNE focuses on preserving local relationships between data points, making it ideal for exploring clusters in data."

                "**Gradient Descent for Neural Networks**: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the weights in the network. During the backpropagation process, the gradient of the loss function is computed with respect to each weight. The chain rule is used to calculate these gradients by working backwards from the output layer to the input layer. The weights are then updated in the direction of the negative gradient to reduce the loss. This process is repeated until convergence, which means the network has learned to approximate the function."

Each neuron in a neural network has an activation function, such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Tanh. The gradient of the activation function is computed for each layer, starting from the output layer and propagating backward. This gradient tells how much the activation function contributed to the error in the network. For example, the gradient for the Sigmoid function is calculated as the derivative of the Sigmoid function itself. These gradients are essential for adjusting weights and minimizing the loss during training."
